# B8IS130-CA
Introduction to my CA.
My CA will be on an Income Pipeline.
The Purpose of this is to develop a data acquisition and preprocessing Pipeline of my Choice. I have decided to make one based on income in the USA. 
This will be done primarily through python (using PANDA)
I will be tasked to extract the data, transforming appropriate features and the reloading into an appropriate database.

This project will be required to access the chosen database. extracting it and showing it.
It will also be required to process the data as needed.

The plan was to used python however after many failed attempts at connecting python to github, I have decided to instead run this through google colab instead
